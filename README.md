## 🧠 AI Usage Report

### AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** – Main assistant used throughout development
- **Claude (Anthropic)** – For UI/UX refinement and layout suggestions

### Key Use Cases

AI tools played a major role in the development of this project, especially in accelerating the design and coding process. Here's how they were used effectively:

- 🧱 **Component Planning**: ChatGPT helped break the dashboard into reusable components like stat cards, charts, data tables, and theme toggles.
- ⚙️ **Code Generation**: It was used to write clean TypeScript components, utility functions, and Tailwind-powered layouts.
- 🐞 **Debugging Help**: AI assisted in resolving issues like import errors, layout bugs, and state management improvements.
- 🎨 **UI/UX Enhancements**: Claude provided layout and spacing refinements, and suggested improvements for responsiveness and hierarchy.
- 📄 **Documentation Support**: This README and the AI Usage Report were generated with AI help to ensure clarity, consistency, and professional formatting.

> Note: Lovable AI integration was explored conceptually as a future feature but **was not implemented** in this version of the project.
